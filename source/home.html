	<h1>AI-Powered Wildlife Classification</h1>
	<p>We’re developing a wildlife monitoring system that is able to capture bio-photonic signals, detect them over significant distances, and automatically classify them through Machine Learning.</p>

		<h2>A novel way to detect wildlife</h2>
		<p>We’re developing a detector that uses properties of eye-shine to detect nocturnal wildlife. We’re also using Machine Learning technology to build a model and classify collected data.</p>

		<h2>A solution for problems in ecology</h2>
		<p>Current monitoring techniques are labour-intensive, subjective and unreliable. Further, current approaches do not reflect data across a systematic level.</p>
